###### Borghese Gallery and Museum

The Galleria Borghese (Italian for 'Borghese Gallery') is an art gallery in **Rome, Italy**, housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese gardens are considered a separate tourist attraction. The Galleria Borghese houses a substantial part of the Borghese Collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of **Pope Paul V** (reign 1605–1621).
